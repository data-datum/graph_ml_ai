## Probabilistic Graphical Models 
Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) use graphs to compactly represent high dimensional multimodal joint distributions over random variables. Factorizing the joint distribution via the graph (or equivalently via conditional independence) facilitates efficient queries. This makes PGMs very effective at modelling complex relationships between variables.
